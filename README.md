# Modular Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game build with components and then shared them to [bit](https://bit.dev/joshk/tic-tac-toe-game) for testing in the live PlayGround and allow users to consume the entire game or just a part of the game components using NPM and Yarn or using bit to consume and modify the component directly inside the project.  

The game has multiple options to modify the game rules, like the dynamic dimension of the table, and the number of matching value to win the game.
